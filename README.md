home lab things

Welcome to my GitHub for RainbowLab. I am an inspiring CyberSecurity professional that has been working in IT for 5+ years now. I am re-introuducing myself to GitHub for the sake of building a homelab. My new GitHub repository is called rainbow-meme. 

Initially, I only wanted to pursue Penetration Analyst, but I am considering other fields such as SIEM engineer, Governance, Risk, and Compliance(GRC), and Cloud engineering.

The things I am considering for my homelab are, but not limited to:
1. Win Server 2022 and Win 10 Enterprise server-client lab setup
2. SIEM lab for GrayLog - this could end up being a different application 
3. Kali Linux to practice with hacking tools

These plans are still developing and I will make changes to this file along the way.
